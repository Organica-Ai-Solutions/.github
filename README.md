## 🧠 Our Vision

We believe in **engineering intelligence with integrity** — not hype.  
Organica AI Solutions builds modular AI systems that combine **LLMs, physics-based learning, real-time decision layers, and multi-agent coordination** into working software deployed in **drones, scientific discovery, and AGI-grade infrastructure**.

## 🚀 Flagship Projects

### 🔬 [NIS Protocol](https://github.com/Organica-Ai-Solutions/NIS_Protocol)
A multi-agent, neuro-inspired system protocol for building honest, interpretable, and adaptable AI systems — from drones to archaeology to exoplanet discovery.

- ✅ Version: `v3.0`
- 🧠 Supports: KAN, PINNs, LangGraph, ReAct, BitNet, and more
- 📄 [Whitepaper (417 lines)](https://github.com/Organica-Ai-Solutions/NIS_Protocol/blob/main/docs/NIS_Protocol_V3_Technical_Whitepaper.md)
- 📁 2,700+ lines of production code, 100% integrity audited

---

### 🚁 [NIS Drone](https://github.com/Organica-Ai-Solutions/NIS-DRONE)
Real-time autonomous drone system powered by the NIS Protocol.

- 🖥️ BitNet 1-bit Edge AI
- ☁️ Kimi K2 Strategic Cloud Intelligence
- 🌤️ Weather-Aware Decision Engine
- 🔐 Multi-layer safety protocols (Edge + Physics + Weather)

---

### 🪐 [NIS-X](https://github.com/Organica-Ai-Solutions/NIS-X)
Exoplanet discovery and spectral interpretation system submitted to **NeurIPS Ariel Data Challenge 2025**.

- 🧪 Physics-informed spectral analysis using KAN + PINN
- 🌌 Discover atmospheric compositions across 1100+ planets
- 🧠 First honest, interpretable model to match physics constraints with LLM-scale cognition

---

### 🌐 NIS HUB (Private)
Distributed AI cognition layer for planetary-scale coordination of NIS systems.

- 🛰️ Think: A decentralized cortex across smart cities, drones, space probes, and research agents

---

## 🧰 Core Toolkits

- `NIS Developer Toolkit (NDT)` — System integration, testing, and protocol compliance
- `NIS Agent Toolkit (NAT)` — Build compliant Reasoning, Vision, Memory, and Action agents
- `Integrity Audit Stack` — Git hooks, validation scripts, anti-hype enforcement tools

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

- ✅ **Honest Engineering**: No fake demos. No hallucinated claims. Full implementation or nothing.
- 🧬 **Neuro-Inspired Design**: Modular intelligence modeled after biological systems
- 📐 **Physics-Informed Models**: Reality-constrained learning (KANs, PINNs)
- 🧠 **Multi-Agent Systems**: Cognitive functions distributed across Reasoning, Vision, Emotion, and Memory agents
- 🧾 **Verifiability by Design**: All code audited, benchmarked, and documented
